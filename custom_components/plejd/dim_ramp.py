"""Smooth remote-driven dimming for Plejd lights over the fast gateway path.

A dimmer remote's "move while held, stop on release" actions (IKEA/Hue style) map to
:meth:`PlejdDimRamp.start` / :meth:`PlejdDimRamp.stop`: start walks the target output's
brightness one step per tick in the given direction until released or a bound is hit.
It rides the coordinator's gateway command path, which delivers each step reliably since
the ack fix (#77) — so the ramp is smooth instead of the chunky input_number workaround.
