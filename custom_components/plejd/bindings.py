"""Remote → light dim bindings, managed by the integration.

A binding maps a remote's hold/release actions (any HA device trigger — IKEA, Hue, ZHA,
Zigbee2MQTT, …) to smooth hold-to-dim of a target: any Home Assistant light or a whole
area, Plejd or not. Bindings are stored here and their triggers attached via HA's generic
trigger machinery. When a trigger fires, a target that is a single Plejd light rides
Plejd's native ramp (`start_dim`/`stop_dim` over the site's chosen transport, with local
level tracking); every other target — an area, a device, multiple or non-Plejd entities —
uses a generic `light.turn_on` brightness-step ramp so it works for every light.
