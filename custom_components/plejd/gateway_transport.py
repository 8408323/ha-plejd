"""Plejd gateway (remote / cloud) WebSocket transport.

Connects to the Plejd remote-control WebSocket (``wss://ws-ie.api.plejd.cloud``),
relays plaintext mesh commands, and tracks output state from ``MeshStateReply``
reports. The cloud/gateway holds the site crypto key, so this path is unencrypted —
it reuses ``protocol.encode_command`` and the codec in ``gateway.py``. See
docs/gateway_protocol.md.

An initial snapshot is requested on connect; after that, every state change (our own
commands and physical/off-app changes) arrives as a ``mesh.out`` push and is decoded
like a BLE LastChanged broadcast — no polling.
