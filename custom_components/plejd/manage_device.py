"""Remove a Plejd device from the site.

The HA-facing orchestration around cloud.py's async_remove_device: mutate on
the cloud, then refresh and reload the config entry so the change is
reflected. Shared by the remove_device service.

Removing a device is decommissioning it - unlike removing a room or scene
(which still exist for other things to reference), a removed device's own
automations/dim-bindings naturally going stale afterward is expected, the
same as removing any other HA device, not a dependency to guard against.
