"""Create, update, and remove Plejd cloud schedules (astro triggers + night reduction).

The real Plejd app's "Schemaläggning" feature - confirmed via a live capture to be
entirely cloud-side: a TimeEvent Parse object (the sunset/sunrise-relative trigger, plus
an optional night-reduction quiet-hours window) and one or two ordinary (hidden) scenes
it runs, tied together by a CreatedById embedded in each scene's own settings JSON. Not
the on-device weekly schedules schedule_ws.py manages (entry.options[CONF_SCHEDULES],
CMD_TIME_EVENT_* mesh commands) - that's a separate, BLE-only mechanism; like
manage_scene.py, this one never touches the mesh directly.

Create and update are confirmed to be genuinely separate Parse functions
(createTimeEvent_V3 / updateTimeEvent_V3) - creation gets a server-generated id back
(the response's eventId), so a scene's CreatedById tag can only be set in a follow-up
updateScene call once that id is known; the scenes themselves are created untagged.
Removal is a whole-state updateTimeEvent_V3 resend with dirtyRemove=true, followed by
the dedicated removeTimeEvent_V3 call - see async_remove_schedule's docstring for what's
simplified relative to the captured sequence.

getSiteById's own response for existing cloud schedules hasn't been captured/confirmed,
so this only tracks schedules created through this integration itself
(entry.data[CONF_CLOUD_SCHEDULES]) - async_update_schedule/async_remove_schedule can only
target one of those, not a schedule created through the app. Only "astro" mode (the only
one captured) is supported; a fixed-clock-time trigger mode's wire shape is unconfirmed.

    the TimeEvent call's dirtyDevices/dirtyRemovedDevices does.
